# WARP 2.0: Automated Wardriving Kit for Raspberry Pi

WARP 2.0 is an automated Kismet-based wardriving deployment tailored for Raspberry Pi 4/5 running Kali Linux ARM64. WARP 2.0 uses Kismet, GPS logging, and cloud integration (AWS S3) to function as a lean, power-efficient mobile wireless recon utility.

## Features

- üì° **Wireless Packet Capture** via Alfa AWUS036ACH/RTL8814AU chipset
- üõ∞Ô∏è **GPS Logging** with GPSD and USB GPS receivers
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Sync** to AWS S3 with hash verification
- üß† **Smart Autostart**: Automatically launches Kismet when offline
- üîí **Basic Web UI Auth** with user-defined login for Kismet dashboard
- ‚öôÔ∏è **System Optimizations** for power saving and persistent logging
- üöÄ **One-Command Setup** with full automation via shell script (experimental)

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (ARM64 Kali Linux recommended)
- USB Wi-Fi adapter (RTL8814AU recommended, like Alfa AWUS1900)
- USB GPS Receiver (e.g UBX-G7020KT )
- 16GB+ microSD card
- External battery or mobile power supply
- AWS S3 bucket and credentials (for cloud sync)

## Installation

1. Flash **Kali ARM64** to your SD card.
2. Create a user (default: `driver`).
3. Clone this repository and run:

```bash
chmod +x \*.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

4. Follow the prompts to configure your S3 bucket, GPS device, and GUI credentials.

## Maintenance & Cleanup

After install, run the post-install cleanup to slim the system:

```bash
chmod +x post_install_cleanup.sh
sudo ./post_install_cleanup.sh
```

This disables unnecessary services, clears logs/histories, and prepares the system for efficient field use.

## Log Syncing

Logs are rotated and synced automatically when an internet connection becomes available. A systemd daemon monitors network state and performs uploads with hash verification.

## Kismet Access

If enabled during intial setup the wlan0 interface creates a management Wi-Fi Access Point(AP) allowing operator to access the Kismet GUI or SSH into the device.

- Dashboard: `http://<Pi_IP>:2501`
- Credentials are saved to `~/.kismet/kismet_httpd.conf` after setup.

## Usage Behavior
The WARP 2.0 system is designed to automatically manage scanning and log synchronization based on network availability:

**No Internet at Boot:**
If the system is started without an internet connection, it assumes a field deployment and automatically launches Kismet in headless scanning mode with GPS support.

**Internet Present at Boot:**
If a connection is detected during boot, the system will not start scanning. Instead, it enters sync mode, where all previously recorded Kismet logs are securely uploaded to the configured AWS S3 bucket. The system uses hash confirmation to ensure each log has been fully and correctly transferred before removing it from local storage.

**Connection Lost After Boot:**
If internet connectivity is lost after startup (e.g., due to signal drop or intentional disconnection), a restart timer is triggered. After a short delay, the system automatically launches Kismet scanning again‚Äîassuming the user completed preflight setup (e.g., interface, GPS, logging, and user credentials).

‚ö†Ô∏è Preflight Reminder: Ensure the wireless interface, GPS device, and permissions are correctly configured before field use. Logs will only be captured and synced if all components are operational.

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements

### üîê WireGuard VPN Integration

Future versions will support secure VPN tunnels via **WireGuard**, allowing for encrypted real-time access to logs or remote administration while on the road.

### üì∂ Sixfab Mobile Cellular Modem Support

Integrate with **Sixfab LTE cellular HATs** to provide mobile internet for cloud sync and remote access in the field, without dependency on Wi-Fi APs.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the GPS device is listed at `/dev/ttyACM0` and detected by gpsd.
- To manually bring down Wi-Fi: `sudo ip link set eth0 down`
- Verify S3 upload: `aws s3 ls s3://<your-bucket-name>`
